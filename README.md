# Business Intelligence — Streamlit + monday.com

Minimal Streamlit app that fetches data from monday.com, cleans it, computes simple BI metrics, and answers founder-level questions via an LLM/agent.

## Quick start

- Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Run the app: `streamlit run app.py`

## Project layout

- `app/` — application modules (monday client, cleaner, metrics, llm, agent)
- `images/` — place image files referenced below

## Images

Add three images into the `images/` folder. The README references these placeholder names — replace with your files as needed:

- images/image1.png
- images/image2.png
- images/image3.png
- images/image4.png
- images/image5.png
- images/image6.png

You can reference them in README or the UI like:

![Image 1](images/image1.png)

![Image 1](images/image2.png)

![Image 1](images/image3.png)


## Notes

- Config values are intentionally simple and hardcoded for ease of local development (see `app/config.py`).
- The agent can operate without LangChain installed; installing `langchain` enables the optional agent pattern.
# Monday.com BI Agent - Minimal Backend

A simple FastAPI application that connects to monday.com, fetches deals and work order data, cleans it, and answers founder-level business questions using LLM-powered insights.

## 🎯 Quick Start

### 1. Setup Environment

```bash
cd /home/oxytocin/Documents/code/Bussiness_intelligence

```
MONDAY_API_KEY=your_key
DEALS_BOARD_ID=your_id
WORK_ORDERS_BOARD_ID=your_id
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run Server

```bash
python app/main.py
```

Server starts at `http://localhost:8000`

### 4. Test Endpoint

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "What is our total pipeline?"}'
```
